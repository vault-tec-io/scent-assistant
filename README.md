## &#x1F527; Troubleshooting

### Diffuser not found in BLE scan

- Make sure no other device is connected to the diffuser via Bluetooth (close the app on your phone)
- Try power-cycling the diffuser
- If your HA device is too far away, consider using an [ESPHome Bluetooth Proxy](https://esphome.io/components/bluetooth_proxy.html)

### Commands sent but diffuser doesn't respond

- Check the HA logs for BLE connection errors
- Try reloading the integration: **Settings > Devices & Services > Scent Assistant > three dots > Reload**
- Power-cycle the diffuser

### Fan switch not available

Fan control is only available via Bluetooth. If you set up the device via Cloud/WiFi, the fan switch will not appear. This is a limitation of the Aroma-Link cloud API.

### Aroma-Link state updates and live countdowns

By default BLE uses connect-on-demand: state is read at setup and notifications
are received while connected. Values are snapshots between connections. A normal
idle disconnect does not make those cached entities unavailable.

For live updates, open **Settings > Devices & Services > Scent Assistant >
Configure** on an Aroma-Link BLE entry and enable **Enable live updates**. This
keeps a Bluetooth connection open, reads fan and full status about every five
seconds, and refreshes schedule/oil metadata about once a minute. The active
countdown ticks every second between device reports and has the attribute
`estimated_between_updates: true`. Only the observed phase is counted down;
the integration does not predict another spray cycle after the counter expires.

Live mode uses a Bluetooth adapter/proxy connection slot. Close the vendor app
before enabling it; disable live mode before using the app again. On loss of
connection or 30 seconds without a parsed reply, entities become unavailable.
Failed refreshes wait at least 30 seconds before an automatic retry. Turn live
mode off to return to connect-on-demand, particularly on an unreliable BLE link.
Home Assistant's **Enable polling for updates** system option must also be on.

Aroma-Link replies can span several Bluetooth notifications. The integration
reassembles and validates those packets before updating entities, including the
U5's full-status reply. Fan state is explicitly read using the same `52 03`
request used by the vendor app, so it need not be toggled to obtain its state.
Some firmware may not answer the full-status `52 0A` read repeatedly. In that
case the countdown cannot stay synchronized: it becomes unavailable after the
observed phase expires instead of fabricating further cycles. Live hardware
validation is needed to establish each firmware's behavior.

### BLE range issues

The integration uses connect-on-demand: it briefly connects, sends the command, then disconnects after 10 seconds. If your HA host is too far from the diffuser, consider:

- An [ESPHome Bluetooth Proxy](https://esphome.io/components/bluetooth_proxy.html) (ESP32, ~$5)
- A USB Bluetooth dongle closer to the diffuser

## &#x1F4D6; Technical Details

This integration was built by reverse engineering the BLE protocols of both device types. For full protocol documentation, see [PROTOCOL.md](PROTOCOL.md).

| Protocol | Header | Checksum | Features |
|----------|--------|----------|----------|
| Aroma-Link | `A5 AA AC ... C5 CC CA` | XOR | Power, fan, per-day scheduling (5 slots), time sync |
| Tuya BLE (Aroma Buddy) | `55 AA ...` | Sum mod 256 | Power, scheduling (5 setups), time sync |
| Scent Marketing AK | `8F` login (PIN 8888) + `2A`/`4A` schedule | None (length-framed) | Power, Fan, Program, schedule read-back; V2 + V3 variants |
| Aromely Aro Max | `55 <dir> <reg> <type> [len payload]` on FFE0/FFE1/FFE2 | Sum mod 256 | Power, fan, daily schedule (work/pause as u16 seconds) |

## &#x1F91D; Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have a diffuser that uses the Aroma-Link or Aroma Buddy app and can help test, please [open an issue](https://github.com/mr-sparks/scent-assistant/issues).

### Running regression tests

Use Python 3.14.2 or newer for the Home Assistant 2026.9 test environment:

```sh
python -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/python -m pip install -r requirements-test.txt
.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q
```

Tests replay sanitized U5 notification layouts through the protocol, device,
and entity code, and cover live countdowns, disconnect/reconnect, command
serialization, and options/setup cleanup. They do not connect to a real diffuser.
