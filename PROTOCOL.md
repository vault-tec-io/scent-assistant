[start_h]     - Start hour (0-23)
[start_m]     - Start minute (0-59)
[end_h]       - End hour (0-23)
[end_m]       - End minute (0-59)
[enabled]     - 0=disabled, 1=enabled
[work_hi]     - Work duration seconds (big-endian 16-bit)
[work_lo]
[pause_hi]    - Pause duration seconds (big-endian 16-bit)
[pause_lo]
```

Full DP18 write:
```
55 AA 00 06 00 3B 12 00 00 37 [setup0: 11 bytes] [setup1: 11 bytes] ... [setup4: 11 bytes] [checksum]

Example - Setup 0: Monday+Tuesday, 08:00-18:00, work=30s, pause=60s:
```
Setup 0: 00 03 08 00 12 00 01 00 1E 00 3C
         idx days strt  end   en work  pause
```

## Aroma-Link Protocol (Custom)

### Packet Format
```
A5 AA AC [xor_checksum] [payload...] C5 CC CA
```
- **Header**: `A5 AA AC` (fixed)
- **XOR checksum**: XOR of all payload bytes
- **Trailer**: `C5 CC CA` (fixed)

### Command Types (first byte of payload)
- `0x52` = Read/Query (app -> device)
- `0x53` = Status Report (device -> app)
- `0x57` = Write/Command (app -> device)

### Sub-Commands

| Cmd | SubCmd | Direction | Description |
|-----|--------|-----------|-------------|
| 0x57 | 0x08 | Write | Power control |
| 0x57 | 0x03 | Write | Fan control |
| 0x57 | 0x16 | Write | Schedule config |
| 0x57 | 0x17 | Write | Time sync |
| 0x52 | 0x01 | Query | Device name |
| 0x52 | 0x03 | Query | Fan status |
| 0x52 | 0x0D | Query | Device info |
| 0x52 | 0x15 | Query | All schedules |
| 0x53 | 0x08 | Report | Power state |

| 0x53 | 0x09 | Report | Spray cycle status |
| 0x53 | 0x0A | Report | Full status (after time sync) |

### Commands

**Power ON:**
```
A5 AA AC 5E 57 08 01 C5 CC CA
```

**Power OFF:**
```
A5 AA AC 5F 57 08 00 C5 CC CA
```

**Fan ON:**
```
A5 AA AC 44 57 03 10 C5 CC CA
```

**Fan OFF:**
```
A5 AA AC 54 57 03 00 C5 CC CA
```

**Time Sync:**
```
A5 AA AC [xor] 57 17 [year_hi year_lo] [month] [day] [hour] [min] [sec] [weekday] C5 CC CA
```
Year: full year as 16-bit big-endian (e.g., 0x07EA = 2026)
Weekday: 1=Monday ... 7=Sunday (ISO weekday)

### Schedule Configuration (57 16)

The Aroma-Link stores schedules **per day of the week**. Each day has 5 independent time slots.

Write command data (46 bytes after 57 16):
```
[weekday_mask]  (1 byte - which day(s) to write to)

5x Slot, each 9 bytes:
  [start_h]     - Start hour (0-23)
  [start_m]     - Start minute (0-59)
  [end_h]       - End hour (0-23)
  [end_m]       - End minute (0-59)
  [flags]       - 0x11 = slot enabled, 0x10 = slot disabled
  [work_hi]     - Work duration seconds (big-endian 16-bit)
  [work_lo]
  [pause_hi]    - Pause duration seconds (big-endian 16-bit)
  [pause_lo]
```

Weekday mask: bit0=Mon, bit1=Tue, bit2=Wed, bit3=Thu, bit4=Fri, bit5=Sat, bit6=Sun

Example - Thursday, Slot 1: 13:15-21:30, work=35s, pause=55s:
```
A5 AA AC [xor] 57 16
  08                          <- Thursday (bit 3)
  0D 0F 15 1E 11 00 23 00 37 <- Slot 1: 13:15-21:30, ON, work=35, pause=55
  00 00 00 00 10 00 0A 00 78  <- Slot 2: disabled, defaults
  00 00 00 00 10 00 0A 00 78  <- Slot 3: disabled, defaults
  00 00 00 00 10 00 0A 00 78  <- Slot 4: disabled, defaults
  00 00 00 00 10 00 0A 00 78  <- Slot 5: disabled, defaults
C5 CC CA
```

### Status Reports

**Spray cycle status (53 09):**
```
53 09 [phase] [work_hi work_lo] [pause_hi pause_lo] [start_h start_m] [end_h end_m] [enabled]
```
Phase: 0x00=idle, 0x01=spraying, 0x02=paused

**Power state (53 08):**
```
53 08 [state]   <- 0x01=on, 0x00=off
```

**Fan state (53 03):**
```
53 03 [state]   <- 0x10=on, 0x00=off
```

The app also reads fan state with `52 03`; the reply is `52 03 [state]`
using the same encoding. This read is necessary to discover the fan's state
without first sending a fan command.

**Full status (53 0A push / 52 0A read response):**

Offsets below are relative to the payload, starting at the command byte.

| Offset | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| 2–9 | Device date/time and weekday |
| 10 | Fan/lamp nibbles (read fan separately; not decoded here) |
| 11 | Power: 0 off, 1 on |
| 12 | Phase: 0 idle, 1 spraying, 2 paused |
| 13–14 | Work seconds remaining, big-endian |
| 15–16 | Pause seconds remaining, big-endian |
| 17–20 | Start HH:MM and end HH:MM |
| 30–31 | Battery percentage and has-battery flag |

**Stored schedules (52 15):** The U5 replies with 315 data bytes after
`52 15`: Monday through Sunday, five nine-byte slots per day. Each slot is
`start_h start_m end_h end_m enabled work_hi work_lo pause_hi pause_lo`.
The enabled byte is `10` (disabled) or `11` (enabled), as in a schedule write.
There is no weekday mask in the reply. This 324-byte framed response restores
configured durations even for a disabled program; countdown fields must not
be used in its place. The current slot is selected using the device clock.

These frames exceed the usual 20-byte notification payload. A U5 over an
ESPHome proxy can deliver a single reply as 20 + 20 + remaining bytes. Keep
the `A5 AA AC` through `C5 CC CA` frame buffered across notifications, verify
its XOR checksum, and only then parse it. Clear incomplete frames between
connections. One notification may also contain multiple complete frames.

Live display uses the last full-status phase and remaining seconds as its
reference, then subtracts elapsed monotonic time until a newer full-status
reply resynchronizes it. This is an estimate between reports, not a promise
that the hardware broadcasts once a second. The public vendor-app capture
in [issue 18](https://github.com/mr-sparks/scent-assistant/issues/18#issuecomment-4691039360)
confirms the initial time-sync/full-status exchange and dedicated fan read;
it does not establish a periodic polling cadence during active diffusion.

## Building Packets (Python)

```python
# Tuya (ShinePick)
def tuya_packet(cmd: int, data: bytes) -> bytes:
    pkt = bytes([0x55, 0xAA, 0x00, cmd, (len(data) >> 8) & 0xFF, len(data) & 0xFF]) + data
    return pkt + bytes([sum(pkt) & 0xFF])

def tuya_dp_bool(dp_id: int, value: bool) -> bytes:
    data = bytes([dp_id, 0x01, 0x00, 0x01, 0x01 if value else 0x00])
    return tuya_packet(0x06, data)

# Aroma-Link
def aroma_link_packet(payload: bytes) -> bytes:
    xor = 0
    for b in payload:
        xor ^= b
    return bytes([0xA5, 0xAA, 0xAC, xor]) + payload + bytes([0xC5, 0xCC, 0xCA])
```

## Notes
- BLE allows only ONE connection at a time - disconnect apps before connecting from HA/Mac
- Both devices use service UUID 0000FFF0 and write to characteristic FFF2
- Aroma-Link has additional WiFi capability (cloud API documented elsewhere) but BLE is preferred for local control
- Time sync should be sent on every connection to keep device clock accurate
- ShinePick minimum pause time is 15 seconds
- Aroma-Link default values: work=10s, pause=120s
